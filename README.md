# Jack Kendrick's Software Engineering Portfolio 

## Description

Welcome to Jack Kendrick's Software Engineering Portfolio! This React-based application showcases my latest projects and allows me to share my work with fellow developers. Through this portfolio, I aim to collaborate on future projects and demonstrate my skills in web development and software engineering.

In the React portfolio application, you will find:

- A single-page application portfolio for a web developer
- A header with the developer's name and navigation titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio
- Navigation titles for About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, with the currently selected section highlighted
- Seamless navigation between sections without page reloading
- The About Me section featuring a recent photo or avatar and a brief bio about me
- The Portfolio section displaying titled images of six of my applications with links to both the deployed applications and their corresponding GitHub repositories
- The Contact section providing a contact form with fields for name, email address, and message
- Form field validation, providing notifications for required fields and invalid email addresses
- The Resume section with a downloadable link and a list of my proficiencies
- A footer with links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, as well as my profile on a third platform (e.g., Stack Overflow or Twitter).
